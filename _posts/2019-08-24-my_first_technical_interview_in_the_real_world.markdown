Maybe calling it an interview is a bit of a stretch – screening would probably be more apt. It was an automated question and coding session. Basically I was given 2 scenarios with a bit of history; 1 debug, 1 new feature. The task was to take into context the history I was given about the project and proceed forward how I say best fit. Oh yeah, and there’s a time limit. 90 minutes to get it all done. In my head, 90 minutes was more than enough for a couple exercises. Perhaps my first mistake was underestimating the challenge. From my experience I’ve come up with a few dos and don’ts.

## Don’t underestimate the stress

Realizing that I wasn’t going to be dealing with a live person made the task seem easy. I often feel I struggle with communication and vocabulary in live settings. So ridding myself of those two stressors should have made for a relaxing coding session – but it didn’t. Knowing that this was for a legitimate position and not just a mock scenario was nagging at me the whole time. Was my solution right? Was it sloppy? Am I going to run out of time?

Don’t underestimate the tricks your mind can play on you. Here’s the trick though, it your mind playing the tricks - which means you can control it. Next time I go into one of these scenarios I’ll be sure to take these negative thoughts into consideration and be ready to deal with them so that I can keep focused on the task at hand.

## Do read all the material you are given

All of it? Really??? But there's a time limit?!!?!!

As I said before, there’s a bit of history I was given on the scenarios. I found myself having to reread content because I had skimmed over it the first time. There are details within the history that can be important. If you don't think you have time to read it all the first time, let me assure you, you most definitely don't have time to reread it and find the details you missed.

Another key feature I missed in the coding exercise was some helper functions that were given to use in the solution. Again, I saw some functions – didn’t invest the time to read through the comments – then spent more time implementing my own version of them. Read, read, read. I felt as though I needed to spend more of the time coding and less of the time reading. Hindsight is 20/20, do read all the material. It will save you time in the long run.

## Do change direction

For my specific screening process, the debugging went fairly well. I was able to find the problem through by overuse of console.log(). Came up with a workaround solution, made notes why it wasn’t a permanent fix, and suggestions as to how to permanently fix the problem. Everything flowed rather smooth.

The second exercise, creating a new feature, wasn’t as smooth. It involved working with some arrays of data. I saw two paths that could yield a solution – one using [.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), the other using [.forEach().](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) I opted for the former. There’s a certain elegance that I feel [.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) brings to the table. Of course sometimes with elegance comes a bit of mental gymnastics to wire up the logic of it. That’s where I got lost.

My solution wasn’t coming together. Why isn’t it working? Maybe I should try some simple test cases in the browser console? Yep, it works as I expect it to. Maybe I should console.log() something at every step of the way to see what’s happening? Nope, waaaaaayyyyy too much info. Maybe I should change direction and use [.forEach().](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)? Absolutely not! No time for that!!! Maybe I should keep doing all these other things that haven’t worked and expect a different result? YES!!!!

With about 15 minutes left, I changed direction. With 5 minutes left, I had already sorted out the logic that I couldn’t get through with [.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). 10 minutes. 10 minutes is all it took to rewrite my solution.

## Do practice

After completing the coursework at Flatiron, I’ve become a big fan of [Codewars](https://codewars.com). I intend to use some of the scenarios at codewars as a means of practicing for these live coding scenarios or screenings. They are often problems that seem to have simple solutions on the surface, but as one gets closer to the solution there are some buried nuances that have to be addressed to arrive at a valid solution. While codewars doesn’t have a timed version (at least that I’m aware), there’s nothing stopping me from giving myself a time limit to arrive at the solution.

## Do visualize

Think about the things that affect you everyday in your coding or work environment. Those things that bring stress are potentially still going to come up in these situations. Visualize yourself in that situation where all of the sudden the stress does get to you. How do you get out of it? 

For starters, take your time to familiarize yourself with your surroundings. There is perhaps nothing scarier than becoming stressed in an unfamiliar location – be it physcially or mentally. Remind yourself you are capable. Breathe and be awesome! 

### You got this.
