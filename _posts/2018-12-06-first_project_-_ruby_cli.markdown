So I've arrived at the first big project, and really the final, for Ruby - creating a CLI to scrape some data. Part of what always holds me back on projects like this is simply coming up with an idea. Looking for the one "perfect" thing that no one has thought of that will solve all the world's problems as well. I think I've found it:

I'm going to scrape weather data.

Ok, so maybe this isn't the newest thing out there. In fact it's probably the oldest. The goal of the project isn't to make the newest thing, it's to demonstrate the ability to create classes and gather data according to user input. So that's what I'm going to do. 

With the basic idea, I'll focus next on the structure for the CLI. The only other project I've personally done is [PyRad](https://github.com/bschrag620/PyRad), a line-by-line radiative transfer model for an atmosphere. While the project started out with some clean and concise code, it quickly devolved. While it does still work as intended, it feels like much of it has been duct taped and band aided together under the hood. I don't expect this project to become as large as PyRad did but without proper planning it could become much worse.
